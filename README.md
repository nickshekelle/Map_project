## MapRange

This project was created using React, Bootstrap, and Node.js

The interactive map is created with MapBox and the 3D Data visulaization is created using Deck.gl

Currently there are two maps, a rockfish density map and a cancer rate map. I plan on adding more maps in the future

To pan the map, hold shift and drag with the mouse. Moving the mouse over a data block will give you more information about that block

Check it out in the "Environment" tab
